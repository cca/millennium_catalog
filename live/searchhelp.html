      If you
      <strong>know</strong>
      the author, the exact title,
        or the call number of the item you want, use these categories to find
        out if it's in the library:

        enter the Author&#8217;s or Artist&#8217;s LAST NAME first, followed by
        the FIRST NAME if known [e.g.,

      If you
      <strong>don&#8217;t know</strong>

            How to find JOURNAL ARTICLES
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you already have a reference or citation to a
          <strong>
            specific
        journal article
          </strong>
          , search the CCA Libraries Catalog under the
          <strong>journal TITLE</strong>
          to see if the periodical is owned by the library.
        Note which volumes and issues that library has, and whether it is bound
        or unbound. Periodicals are shelved alphabetically by title.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't have a particular article in mind or are
        missing the citation, find it with an
          <strong>online periodical index</strong>
          [which is separate from the CCA Libraries Catalog].
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 1: Select and search an index</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          CCA Libraries currently subscribe to four online periodical
        indexes:
          <strong>Art Full Text</strong>
          ,
          <strong>ARTbibliographies Modern</strong>
          ,
          <strong>Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals</strong>
          , and
          <strong>
            Design and Applied Arts Index
          </strong>. Select one of these indexes from
          <a href="http://libraries.cca.edu">the library home page</a>.
        For step-by-step instructions on searching online indexes, use the HELP
        link listed on the index's homepage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Step 2: Identify the relevant article(s) and
        source
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the full-text of the article is not available online,
        write down the journal title, volume/number or month/year, and page number(s)
        of the desired article so that you can find the printed version. You will
        also need this information to cite the article in a footnote or bibliography.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Step 3: Check if CCA Libraries own the printed
        version
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The CCA Libraries do not subscribe to all of the journals
        and magazines in the periodical indexes. Search the TITLE of the periodical
        (not the article) in the CCA Libraries Catalog to see if the printed version
        is available at CCA. To determine the most recent issue received by the
        CCA Libraries, click on &#8220;Latest Received.&#8221; If the journal
        you are looking for is not available at CCA, you may request a copy of
        the article via interlibrary loan; ask a reference librarian.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 4: Locate the specific periodical issue</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you find the periodical title in the CCA Libraries
        Catalog, note its LOCATION (Oakland or San Francisco Periodicals) and
        whether it is shelved in the BOUND (older issues) or recent periodical
        section. Recent periodicals can be checked out, however, bound periodicals
        are library use only.
