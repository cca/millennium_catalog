# Millennium Screens & Web Options

## Notes

The "wwwoptions" files are the most important; they contain global settings that effect all kinds of things in the OPAC.

## Todos

- add in Google Webmasters meta tags (only on live? or both?)
- consider relation between staging/live. Should these ultimately be combined because those are *servers* that should share one code base?
- there are probably still instances of linking to vm-lib-www-dev-01 instead of the live site scattering throughout staging
- delete out unused files, ones with names like "mainmenux.html" "iperror403-network.html" seem they were primitive attempts to do branching with file names
- better patron log in/out screens
- this is probably the place to get online holds working, too
